Time Complexity Analysis for each Tasks:
========================================

Task 0 - Constant time complexity O(1), since items were retrieved from lists using indexing.

Task 1 - Linear time complexity O(n), there are two for loops involved which iterates through whole of the inputs. Therefore the execution time is around sum of the lengths of both inputs.

Task 2 - Same as Task 1

Task 3 - Here there is a for loop which iterates through the entire input, hence linear time complexity, O(n). Since we are using Python's  inbuilt sorted method, which is employing Timsort it has a worst case time complexity of O(nlogn). Hence time complexity for this task is log-linear O(nlogn)

Task 4 - Same as Task 3
